# MFE-IMIntegrator: Streamlining Your Micro-Frontend Architecture üåêüõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to MFE-IMIntegrator! This tool is all about making your life easier when working with Micro-Frontend (MFE) environments. We're here to help you manage and update `importmap.json` files in your MFE projects effortlessly, leveraging the power of Docker to streamline both local and global testing. Let's dive into how you can get everything up and running.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
To kick things off, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. They are crucial for running the MFE-IMIntegrator smoothly.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   
   First things first, let's get the code on your machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MFE-IMIntegrator.git
   cd MFE-IMIntegrator
   ```

2. **Fire It Up with Docker Compose:**

   Getting the tool up and running is a breeze with Docker Compose. In your terminal, simply run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command sets up and starts the Docker container quietly in the background. Wait a few moments for it to spin up.

## Configuration

Here's the fun part - configuration is almost too easy! Once your Docker container is running, it'll listen on port `3333`. What this means for you is that your updated `importmap.json` is now served right from your local setup. 

To use it, just insert the following URL into your `index.ejs` or `index.html` file where your import maps are configured:

```html
<script type="systemjs-importmap" src="http://localhost:3333/importmap.json"></script>
```

And that's it! Your Micro-Frontend setup now has the freshest version of your `importmap.json`, served straight from your local machine. üéâ

## Testing

Want to check if everything's ticking correctly? You can test your `importmap.json` configurations both locally and in a simulated live environment. This Dockerized setup means you can catch any issues early, ensuring a smooth integration with your main project.
